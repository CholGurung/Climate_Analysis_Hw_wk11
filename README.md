## Step 1 - Climate Analysis and Exploration

Topics : a. Precipitation Analysis

         b. Station Analysis

         c. Temperature Analysis (Optional)

## Step 2 - Climate App

Design a Flask API based on the queries that you have just developed.

	* Use FLASK to create your routes.

### Routes

	* `/api/v1.0/precipitation`

	* `/api/v1.0/stations`

  	* `/api/v1.0/tobs`

  	* `/api/v1.0/<start>` and `/api/v1.0/<start>/<end>`

  Prerequisites : 
	The raw data for climate were obtained from “Resources/hawaii.sqlite”. The “climate_starter.ipynb” notebook was then run in jupyter notebook within Anaconda virtual environment. 
Python Flask library must be installed to run the app.py.

  Tools used:
	a. Jupyter Notebook
	b. SQLAlchemy
	c. Flask
	d. Python
